## **📌 Project Overview**
This **Smart Home Security System** uses **OpenCV for motion detection**, **email alerts** for security notifications, and **sensor integration** (temperature, gas, fire).  
The system can work on **both Windows & Raspberry Pi** and supports **live camera streaming**.

---

## **📷 Features**
✅ **Motion Detection** (via OpenCV)  
✅ **Intruder Alerts** (Email Notifications)  
✅ **Live Video Streaming** (Flask-based Web Stream)  
✅ **Sensor Readings** (DHT11 for Temperature & Humidity, Gas & Fire Sensors)  
✅ **Works on Raspberry Pi & Windows**

## **🚀 Installation & Setup**
### **1️⃣ Install Dependencies**
Run the following command to install required Python libraries:
```sh
pip install opencv-python imutils smtplib flask
```

### **2️⃣ Set Up Email Alerts**
- Generate a **Gmail App Password** (instead of using your real password).  
- Update `email_alerts.py` with:
  ```python
  GMAIL_USERNAME = 'your-email@gmail.com'
  GMAIL_PASSWORD = 'your-app-password'  # Use App Password here
  ```

### **3️⃣ Run the Security System**
```sh
python security_system.py
```

### **4️⃣ Start Live Camera Streaming**
```sh
python camera_stream.py
```
Then, open a browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:5000/video_feed
```
✅ **Now, you can see the live camera feed!**  

---

## **💡 How It Works**
1️⃣ **Detects Motion** → Alerts are sent when movement is detected.  
2️⃣ **Monitors Sensors** → Reads temperature, humidity, gas, and fire sensors.  
3️⃣ **Sends Email Alerts** → Notifies you in case of an intruder.  
4️⃣ **Streams Live Video** → View real-time security footage.

## **🛠️ Supported Devices**
- ✅ **Windows** (Simulated sensor values)  
- ✅ **Raspberry Pi** (Real sensor data via GPIO)
